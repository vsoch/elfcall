Generate call graph data for an elf binary.

Elfcall performs two functions:

 - *trees*: generate a tree of libraries akin to what the dynamic linker would see
 - *graphs*: generate a graph that shows linked libraries and symbols exported and needed.

If you have any questions or issues, please `let us know <https://github.com/vsoch/elfcall/issues>`_
